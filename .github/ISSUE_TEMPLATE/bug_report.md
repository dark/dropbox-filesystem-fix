<!--
Please familiarize yourself with the following:

As mentioned in the README, this project is in maintenance mode. I may not be able to help you debug new breakages, nor test any changes.

If you think something is broken and you have a fix, please open a pull request with an explanation, and if it looks reasonable I will merge it. If you have a question, feel free to open an issue; either I or somebody else watching the repo might be able to help, but no promises.
